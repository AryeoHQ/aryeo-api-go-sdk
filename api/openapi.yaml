    # Introduction
    The Aryeo API provides access to the Aryeo platform. You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for interfacing with the Aryeo API, or you can use one of our SDKs. We support a variety of languages and frameworks that are a great starting point for experimenting with the API. If there is an additional language or framework that you want to see supported, then please reach out and make a contribution!

    **Note**: Currently, our SDKs generate some duplicate models. For example, `Listing` and `Listing1`. Each of these models are identical, despite their naming. We hope to resolve this in future versions.

    **Note**: Some SDKs may require you to manually add the `Accept` header to all Aryeo API requests. If so, use the value `application/json`.

    # Version Pinning
    The Aryeo API is versioned. This documentation refers to the most recent version of the API; however, it is possible to use older versions of the API on a request-by-request basis. To explicitly use an older version, pass the `Aryeo-Version` header with a value for the version you would like to use.

    **Example**: `Aryeo-Version: 2021-06-17`

    Information about each API version can be found in the releases section of the [documentation repository](https://github.com/AryeoHQ/aryeo-api-docs).

    # The Include Parameter
    Some endpoints provide a special `include` query parameter. This parameter allows the client to control the nested relations returned by an API response. For example, if a client only needs minimum information, then it may choose to omit the `include` parameter entirely. Or, if a client wants all possible information, then it may provide all possible values in the `include` parameter. This will have the side-effect of increasing the request's latency, but that may be advantageous depending on the client's use case.

    **Hint**: To see all possible values for the `include`  parameter, use an erroneous value such as `./path?include=fake` when making a request. Then, the API will respond with all allowed `include` values for that endpoint.
